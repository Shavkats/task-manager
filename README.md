# Task manager app

## How to use
Enter a task in the input and either press the "Enter" key or the "Save" button. Each task can be edited by clicking the "Pen" icon next to the task title and changes are saved when the "Enter" key is pressed. Tasks can also be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button and also the status of a task can be changed to "Completed" by clicking the "Check" button, which will make the task title rendered as crossed out text.

* Adding search functionality to be able to search for tasks
